# 8th Light Google Book API - Klaven Jones

This is a simple command line application that allows you to search for books and save them to a text file. This application leverages the Google Books API.

# ðŸŸ¢ How to get Started

---

In order to get started you need [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Clone this project:

`git clone https://github.com/klavenjones/8th-light-book-cli.git`

Go into the directory:

`cd 8th-light-book-cli`

Install dependencies:

`yarn install`

# ðŸ’» Running the app

---

Once you've downloaded the dependencies you can run the app using `yarn execute`

From the terminal you will see options, and some instructions on how to run the application.

# âœ…Â Testing

To run tests just run the command `yarn test`.

# Environment Variables

Be sure to add your google api key to a .env file

```jsx

```

# Approach

So I wanted to create a command line application where the application has a set of menu items, that will lead the user to their goal, which is to search for books and save it to a list. I used a cool library called inquire to create the menu for the user. I also used a libraries like chalk and boxen to make it a bit more eye catching for a user when they create the application.

## Challenges and what I learned

### Tests

One of my weakness as a programmer are tests. I have knowledge of how to write tests using libraries like Jest. But I lack the knowledge of writing good meaningful tests and being knowledgable with certain methodologies when it comes to writing test. So I had to do a bit of research and I still have a long way to go in that regard, but I learned quite a bit.

For this project, I started by writing tests that test for the input of the application to make sure it fails when the wrong type of input is given. Iâ€™m eager to learn from the feedback Iâ€™ll receive from you guys!

## fs

Another challenge was learning how to save a file and read a file using JavaScript. After some research I came across this cool library built in to node called fs. Which is quite easy to use and I learned a bit reading it from the docs.
